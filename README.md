## Purpose and target audience
The MMM app is an app for pure entertainment and pastime, an app that tickles your logical thinking and can help you relax for a while, disconnecting from the demands of everyday life. The app is intended to provide more than just the joy of solving the code; you should also take away a wise word along the way. The intended audience comprises individuals with a logical mindset seeking to engage in a bit of brain exercise.

## Game idea
The MMM app will provide a set of instructions, and the ask the user for a username which is used to welcome the user to the game. Then the user is asked to enter a 4 digit code with digits between 1-6 where no digits can be repeated in the code. The code is then validated for:
- not leaving it empty
- 4 digits
- no repetition of digits
- no other characters
- and that the entered numbers are not the same as any previous entry

When validation is completed the user input will be checked against the randomly genereted 4 digit code to see if there is a match, if not each digit in the user input will be checked to see if it exits in the random code, if it does it will also be checked to see if it is in the same position as in the random code. All these will be feeded back to the user to be able to have another stab at solving the code. The user have 10 trials before the game ends and they will be asked oif they want to play again.

When the user solves the code, they will be rewarded with a word of wisdom. These words of wisdoms are randomly generated from a google sheet with 60 messages.
